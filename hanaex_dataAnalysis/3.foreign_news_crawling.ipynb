      "MUNICH & GENEVA, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Mytheresa (NYSE:MYTE) and Richemont (SWX:CFR) announce that they have entered into binding agreements for the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of YNAP by Mytheresa. The transaction aims to create a leading, global, multi-brand digital luxury group offering a highly curated and strongly differentiated edit of the most prestigious luxury brands and products to luxury enthusiasts worldwide.\n",
      "Transaction Rationale\n",
      "Mytheresa and YNAP have each earned a strong reputation in the luxury industry for their pioneering roles in innovation, authoritative editorial voice and curation, as well as high-quality customer service. Together, the different storefronts cover a broad spectrum of the luxury market with distinct propositions in terms of brand portfolio, customer and geographical focus while sharing the strategic positioning towards high end customers.\n",
      "In the medium term, Mytheresa's vision for the combined group entails:\n",
      "The integration of YNAP's Luxury division into Mytheresa, to form one group with three distinct storefronts: MYTHERESA, NET-A-PORTER and MR PORTER, which is expected to:\n",
      "Provide a broader and further differentiated luxury offering towards customers based on distinctive assortments, marketing and customer touchpoints;\n",
      "Offer luxury brand partners an even broader and specific reach of luxury consumers worldwide as a result of distinctive curation and inspiration; and\n",
      "Share infrastructure including Mytheresa`s technology platform and operational best practices to facilitate greater efficiencies while maintaining their distinct brand identities.\n",
      "The separation of the off-price division - comprising YOOX and THE OUTNET, leading destinations for online off-price luxury shopping - from the Luxury division to allow for a simpler and more efficient operating model driving higher growth and profitability.\n",
      "The discontinuation of YNAP's white label division, once the Richemont Maisons' online stores powered by YNAP migrate to their own chosen platforms.\n",
      "3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads.\n",
      "Michael Kliger, CEO of Mytheresa, said: I am truly excited by today's announcement. With this transaction, Mytheresa aims to create a pre-eminent, multi-brand, digital, luxury group worldwide. MYTHERESA, NET-A-PORTER and MR PORTER will offer differentiated but complementary multi-brand luxury edits based on curation, inspiration and outmost customer service. The three brands will share a large part of their infrastructure creating synergies and efficiencies while maintaining their different brand identities. The off-price business will benefit from the separation from luxury and a much simpler operating model driving growth and profitability. We believe that this transaction will create significant value for our shareholders, brand partners and most importantly for our high-end customers.\n",
      "Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said: We are pleased to have found such a good home for YNAP. As a trusted partner to many of the world's leading global luxury brands, YNAP is renowned for its pioneering high-end customer services complemented by its distinctive and inspirational editorial voice. Mytheresa is ideally placed to build on YNAP's assets to further delight customers and brand partners alike across the world by harnessing both companies' respective strengths.\n",
      "Financial consideration\n",
      "At transaction closing, Richemont will sell YNAP to Mytheresa with a cash position of €555m and no financial debt, subject to customary closing adjustments, in exchange for shares to be issued by Mytheresa representing 33% of Mytheresa's fully diluted1 share capital at closing following issuance of the consideration shares. Richemont will make available a 6-year revolving credit facility of €100m to finance YNAP's general corporate needs, including working capital.\n",

      "Richemont will have the right to nominate a member and an observer to the Supervisory Board of Mytheresa following closing.\n",
      "Closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the first half of calendar year 2025, is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of antitrust approvals.\n",
      "The transaction is not subject to or conditional on approval by either Richemont or Mytheresa shareholders.\n",
      "Richemont's shareholding in Mytheresa will be subject to a one-year lock-up period following transaction closing, followed by a further one-year period in which only certain limited sale transactions may take place.\n",
      "As a result of this transaction, Richemont currently expects the write-down of YNAP net assets to amount to approximately €1.3 billion, which also accounts for the cash to be left in YNAP upon completion. This value is subject to change until completion date as it depends on several variables, namely Mytheresa's share price, the USD/EUR foreign exchange rate, the value of net assets and debt-like items of YNAP at completion date.\n",
      "Conference Call Information\n",
      "Mytheresa will host a conference call to discuss the transaction at 8am Eastern Time. Those wishing to participate via webcast should access the call through Mytheresa's Investor Relations website at https://investors.mytheresa.com.

      "Forward Looking Statements\n",
      "This release contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements contained in this release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the timing and completion of and expected benefits from the transactions involving Richemont Maisons, NET-A-PORTER and YNAP, expectations regarding future opportunities and our market position, our business plans and strategy, future financial or operating performance, as well as statements that include the words expect, plan, believe, estimate, may, should, anticipate, will, could, aim, continue and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Richemont's forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions regarding YNAP's business and performance, the economy and other future conditions and forecasts of future events, circumstances and results. Our retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop and a decline in consumer traffic could have a negative effect on our comparable store sales and/or average sales per square foot and store profitability resulting in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Reduced travel resulting from economic conditions, retail store closure orders of civil authorities, travel restrictions, travel concerns and other circumstances, including disease epidemics and other health-related concerns, could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if such events impact our customers' desire to travel to our retail stores. International conflicts or wars, including resulting sanctions and restrictions on importation and exportation of finished products and/or raw materials, whether self-imposed or imposed by international countries, non-state entities or others, may also impact these forward-looking statements. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside Richemont's control. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. In addition, the forward-looking statements made in this release relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this release. Richemont does not undertake to update, nor does it have any obligation to provide updates of, or to revise, any forward-looking statements.\n",

All statements other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or current conditions included in this press release are forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements give Mytheresa's current expectations and projections relating to the proposed transaction and the operation of the combined companies; its financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including statements relating to financing activities, future sales, expenses, and profitability; future development and expected growth of our business and industry; our ability to execute our business model and our business strategy; having available sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to meet working capital, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months; and projected capital spending. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, ongoing, plan, potential, predict, project, should, will, would, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that Mytheresa has made in light of its industry experience and perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this press release, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond Mytheresa's control) and assumptions. Although Mytheresa believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect its actual operating and financial performance and cause its performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Mytheresa believes these factors include, but are not limited to: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination or abandonment of the proposed transaction; the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the proposed transaction with Richemont, including the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals of the proposed transaction that could reduce anticipated benefits or cause the parties to abandon the transaction; the risk that the conditions to closing the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all; the risk that the proposed transaction and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of YNAP to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their brand partners and customers and on their operating results and businesses generally; the risk that problems may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of YNAP and Mytheresa, which may result in the combined company not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected; the risk that the combined company may be unable to achieve cost-cutting synergies or that it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies; Mytheresa's ability to effectively compete in a highly competitive industry; Mytheresa's ability to respond to consumer demands, spending and tastes; Mytheresa's ability to respond to any current or future health epidemic or other adverse public health development; Mytheresa's ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers; consumers of luxury products may not choose to shop online in sufficient numbers; the volatility and difficulty in predicting the luxury fashion industry; Mytheresa's reliance on consumer discretionary spending; and Mytheresa's ability to maintain average order levels and other factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, Mytheresa's actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements.\n",

      "Content: The latest economic data reveals a dip in Consumer Credit, with the actual figure falling short of forecasted numbers. The total value of outstanding consumer credit requiring installment payments currently stands at $8.93 billion.\n",
      "This number is notably lower than the predicted figure of $11.80 billion, marking a significant deviation from the anticipated trajectory. Economists and market analysts had expected a healthier consumer credit scene, but the actual figures have painted a different picture.\n",
      "In addition to falling short of the forecast, the current consumer credit value also represents a steep decline from the previous figure. Previously, the total value of outstanding consumer credit was recorded at $26.63 billion. The current figure of $8.93 billion marks a significant drop, indicating a slowdown in consumer spending and potentially reflecting a dip in consumer confidence.\n",
      "Consumer Credit is a critical economic indicator that measures the change in the total value of outstanding consumer credit requiring installment payments. It is closely correlated with consumer spending and confidence, offering valuable insights into the health of the economy. The figure can be volatile, often subject to sizable revisions.\n",
      "In the context of currency markets, a higher than expected reading is typically taken as positive or bullish for the USD, while a lower than expected reading is considered negative or bearish for the USD. In this instance, the lower than expected reading could potentially exert downward pressure on the USD.\n",
      "The recent dip in Consumer Credit warrants close monitoring in the coming months. It could signal the onset of a trend or simply represent a temporary blip. Either way, it will undoubtedly play a role in shaping economic policy decisions and market movements.\n",

      "Content: Investing.com - US election risk premia are becoming richly priced in the foreign exchange markets, according to Bank of America Securities, but may already be overpriced.\n",
      "Historically most FX vols don’t realize enough to recoup the implied volatility premium around the US election, analysts at the US bank said, in a note dated Oct. 7. “Instead, we see contained volatility as a catalyst for FX carry factor to perform past the election.”\n",
      "The bank noted that significant risk premium is priced in the foreign exchange markets ahead of the US election, especially in the Asian emerging markets. \n",
      "“Here we find that the median major FX pair has priced a 108% premium relative to the average of 2016 and 2020, as measured by the daily bounce in the 2m implied vol 2 months before the US election,” BOA said.\n",
      "However, EM Asia vols have not performed in the US election since 2012, the bank said, and thus it favors fading implied vol. \n",
      "In a benign election scenario, we see USD/CNH spot broadly contained in a 6.85-7.30 range, and strikes at similar levels offer sufficiently attractive premium to vol sellers, in our view. \n",
      "“As a result, we think a short USD/CNH strangle is attractive to fade rich volatility premia. The risk to this view would be for larger-than-expected fiscal stimulus in China to generate outsize USD/CNH swings,” BOA added.\n",

      "The adjustment follows a period of uncertainty for Chemours, marked by management changes, accounting and control issues earlier in the year, as well as volatility in various end-markets and one-off issues. These factors have contributed to questions regarding the company's earnings potential and its projections for 2025.\n",
      "BMO Capital's analysts conducted an in-depth analysis of the various factors affecting Chemours and concluded there is a strong potential for earnings growth.

      "The analyst from BMO Capital expressed confidence in the future performance of Chemours, stating, \"We have attempted a deep dive into the numerous moving pieces and see solid upside to the consensus in 2025 in our Base Case and Bull Case.\" This suggests that despite the challenges faced earlier in the year, the analyst believes Chemours has strong potential for earnings growth and stock price appreciation.\n",

      "Content: MARLBOROUGH, Mass. - Akoya Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKYA), known as The Spatial Biology Company®, has announced its participation in the MANIFEST program, a multimillion-dollar cancer research initiative funded by the UK Office of Life Sciences and the Medical Research Council. The program is designed to advance the understanding of cancer immunotherapy through deep multi-omic profiling.\n",
      "The MANIFEST consortium, which includes top academic institutions, hospitals, and industry partners, is led by the Francis Crick Institute and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. Akoya's PhenoCycler® Fusion and PhenoImager® HT platforms will be instrumental in analyzing tissue samples from thousands of cancer patients to identify biomarkers that could predict the success of immunotherapy treatments and potential side effects.\n",
      "Brian McKelligon, CEO of Akoya Biosciences, expressed the company's pride in contributing their spatial proteomics expertise to the consortium's efforts. The initiative will focus on understanding why some cancer patients respond to immunotherapy while others do not by examining immune cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment.\n",
      "Over a four-year period, the MANIFEST program will evaluate tissue samples from 3000 patients who have completed immunotherapy and 3000 newly treated patients with breast, bladder, kidney, and skin cancer, with plans to include other cancer types in the future.\n",
      "Samra Turajlic, project lead at the Francis Crick Institute and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, highlighted the significant progress made in immunotherapy over the past decade. However, treatment failure and adverse effects remain challenges that MANIFEST aims to address through collaborative innovation.\n",
      "Akoya Biosciences specializes in single-cell imaging solutions that enable researchers to phenotype cells within their spatial context, which is crucial for understanding disease progression and therapy response. The company offers a range of spatial phenotyping solutions to support research across discovery, translational, and clinical stages.\n",

      "In other recent news, Akoya Biosciences has seen considerable developments. The company reported a significant increase in its second-quarter earnings for 2024, with revenue rising by 26% to $23.2 million. This growth was primarily driven by an expansion in reagent volumes and instrument placements. The company is now striving to reach operating cash flow break-even by the end of the year.\n",
      "Additionally, Akoya Biosciences announced the appointment of Scott Mendel as the new Chairman of the Board. Mendel, known for his vast experience and leadership roles in the industry, will replace Robert Shepler, who will continue his involvement with Akoya Biosciences as a board member.\n",
      "However, Morgan Stanley has revised its stance on Akoya Biosciences, downgrading the stock from Overweight to Equalweight due to concerns over weak capital spending. Despite this, the firm recognizes Akoya Biosciences' effective cash management and suggests that investors may need to be patient to see the company's value increase. These are the recent developments in Akoya Biosciences' journey.\n",
      "InvestingPro Insights\n",
      "Akoya Biosciences' participation in the MANIFEST program underscores the company's commitment to advancing cancer research through its innovative spatial biology platforms. However, investors should be aware of the company's current financial position and market performance.\n",
      "According to InvestingPro data, Akoya Biosciences has a market capitalization of $137.61 million USD, reflecting its position as a smaller player in the biotechnology sector. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2023 stood at $93.22 million USD, with a revenue growth of 9.66% over the same period. This growth aligns with the company's expanding role in research initiatives like MANIFEST.\n",

      "InvestingPro Tips highlight that Akoya is quickly burning through cash, which is not uncommon for biotech companies investing heavily in research and development. The company is not profitable over the last twelve months, with an operating income margin of -51.65%. This financial situation is typical for companies in the early stages of commercializing complex technologies.\n",
      "Despite these challenges, Akoya's stock has shown strong returns over the last month and three months, with price total returns of 17.8% and 33.01% respectively. This recent market performance may reflect investor optimism about the company's involvement in high-profile research programs like MANIFEST.\n",
      "It's worth noting that analysts do not anticipate the company will be profitable this year, according to another InvestingPro Tip. This aligns with the company's focus on long-term research and development in the spatial biology field.\n",

      "Content: YANGZHOU, China - Meihua International Medical Technologies Co., Ltd. (Nasdaq: MHUA), a manufacturer of disposable medical devices, has announced that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. The company received a notification on Monday from the Nasdaq Stock Market's Listing Qualifications Department, confirming that its ordinary shares have maintained a minimum bid price of $1.00 or more per share over the last 21 consecutive business days, from September 4, 2024, to October 2, 2024.\n",
      "The compliance milestone follows a previous notification on April 2, 2024, indicating that Meihua's shares had fallen below the $1.00 threshold required by Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) over a 30-day period. The recent improvement in share price has resolved this issue, and the matter is now considered closed.\n",
      "Meihua International operates subsidiaries in China and produces a range of Class I, II, and III disposable medical devices. These products include items such as medical bottles, examination kits, surgical kits, and various medical catheters, which are distributed domestically and exported to over 30 countries worldwide. The company has been serving medical institutions for more than three decades and has received international certifications, including the \"CE\" mark and ISO 13485 system certification. It is also registered with the FDA for over 20 Class I products.\n",
      "The information regarding Meihua's regained compliance is based on a press release statement issued by the company.\n",
      "InvestingPro Insights\n",
      "Meihua International Medical Technologies Co., Ltd. (Nasdaq: MHUA) has not only regained compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement but also demonstrates some intriguing financial characteristics that align with its recent stock performance.\n",
      "3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads.\n",
      "According to InvestingPro data, MHUA's stock has seen a significant 55.22% price total return over the past six months, which corresponds with the company's efforts to meet Nasdaq's listing requirements. This upward trend is particularly noteworthy given the stock's poor performance over longer periods, with InvestingPro Tips highlighting that the price has fallen significantly over the last five years.\n",
      "Despite the recent stock price recovery, MHUA appears to be trading at attractive valuations. The company's P/E ratio stands at a low 2.81, and it's trading at a price-to-book ratio of just 0.18 as of the last twelve months ending Q2 2024. These metrics suggest that the stock may be undervalued relative to its fundamentals.\n",
      "An InvestingPro Tip indicates that MHUA holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as the company moves forward from its compliance issues. Additionally, with a market capitalization of $27.14 million USD, MHUA falls into the small-cap category, which often comes with higher volatility but also potential for growth.\n",

      "Content: DUBLIN - Trinity Biotech plc (NASDAQ:TRIB), a biotechnology company specializing in diagnostic systems and diabetes management, announced today the successful completion of a key pre-pivotal clinical trial in Europe for its innovative continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology. This marks a significant milestone following the acquisition of Waveform Technologies' assets in January 2024.\n",
      "The trial evaluated the enhanced CGM technology's analytical performance, which is part of Trinity Biotech's research and development efforts to improve the device's accuracy and user experience. John Gillard, President and CEO of Trinity Biotech, stated that the positive trial results confirm the effectiveness of the R&D plan and will inform further sensor design optimizations.\n",
      "The updated CGM device features a reduced biosensor wire length, aimed at improving in-body performance. The trial demonstrated that the refined sensor achieved a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) that favorably compares to the previous Waveform device, indicating enhanced accuracy.\n",
      "Dr. Gary Keating, Chief Technology Officer at Trinity Biotech, revealed that the next phase of refinements, guided by the study's positive outcomes, will be tested in a second European pre-pivotal trial scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year. This will set the stage for a pivotal trial planned for 2025.\n",
      "CGMs are crucial in diabetes management, allowing real-time glucose measurement through a biosensor wire placed under the skin. The global CGM market is expanding, with projections estimating it will exceed $20 billion by 2029. Trinity Biotech aims to capture a significant market share with its next-generation CGM technology, which promises affordability, factory calibration, ease of use, and sustainability.\n",
      "3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads.\n",
      "The company has positioned itself in a competitive market with this technological advancement and is expected to contribute to the growing demand for user-friendly and accurate diabetes monitoring solutions.\n",
      "The information in this article is based on a press release statement from Trinity Biotech.\n",
      "In other recent news, Trinity Biotech has acquired Metabolomics Diagnostics, a company specializing in biomarker-based diagnostics, for approximately $1.3 million. This acquisition is expected to enhance Trinity Biotech's diagnostic capabilities, particularly in maternal and fetal health. The company also plans to launch its Continuous Glucose Monitoring technology in India and has revised its 2024 sales revenue forecast for its rapid HIV test, TrinScreen HIV, from $8 million to approximately $10 million. In terms of staffing, Trinity Biotech has appointed Adrian Donohue as Chief Commercial Officer, David Ouston as Biosensor Marketing Director, and Louise Tallon as Chief Financial Officer. Trinity Biotech's Q2 2024 revenues are projected to range from $15.5 to $16.0 million, a year-over-year increase from $13.9 million. These are recent developments that reflect Trinity Biotech's commitment to capturing market opportunities.\n",
      "InvestingPro Insights\n",
      "Trinity Biotech's recent progress in its continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology comes at a critical time for the company. According to InvestingPro data, Trinity Biotech has a market capitalization of $11.36 million USD, reflecting its current position as a smaller player in the biotechnology sector. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 stood at $58.65 million USD, with a revenue growth of 8.6% over the same period.\n",
      "3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads.\n",
      "Despite the positive developments in its CGM technology, InvestingPro Tips highlight some financial challenges facing Trinity Biotech. The company is currently operating with a significant debt burden and is quickly burning through cash. This financial situation underscores the importance of the CGM project's success for Trinity Biotech's future prospects.\n",
      "Interestingly, while the company has seen a significant return over the last week with a 9.09% price increase, it has experienced a substantial decline of 41.18% over the past three months. This volatility may reflect market reactions to the company's ongoing R&D efforts and financial performance.\n",
      "It's worth noting that analysts do not anticipate the company will be profitable this year, which aligns with the reported operating income of -$12.83 million USD for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This emphasizes the critical nature of Trinity Biotech's CGM technology in potentially turning the company's financial performance around.\n",
      "For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights. In fact, there are 8 more InvestingPro Tips available for Trinity Biotech, which could provide valuable context for understanding the company's financial health and market position as it advances its CGM technology.\n",
